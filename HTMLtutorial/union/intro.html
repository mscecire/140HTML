When Maria and Keith first approached me with their plans for Intro to Media, I was excited to hear that it would be a media theory class with an emphasis on attitudes about both consumption and production of media, as well as that developing in between space we might call reproduction, appropriation, re-use, remix, etc.

What can get lost in a theoretical environment where production is not considered is the feeling of necessity for practical applications of media theory, a strategy for the student's own contributions to the mediascape they are analyzing. 

Similarly, a media production course can leave to be desired a certain criticality about the work one is producing and the way it is functioning on and among the consumers from a theoretical perspective.

So the idea for this course is to be both a space for critical thought and discussion about how media works on us and a production workshop encouraging experimentation with how we can work with media.

We have informally titled our summer research project "Hacking The Metamedium." The computer is frequently referred to as "the great metamedium," in which text, sound, still and moving images are collapsed into one location, and that location is increasingly literally at our fingertips. 

This course is an attempt to encourage students, part of a generation sometimes called "the digital natives," to approach the computer (and through it every creative medium) critically, with a grounding in theory. Our hope is that they use it to produce experimental and compelling work which may stray from what we typically understand as scholarly or academic, not because it is lacking in intelligence, seriousness, or rigor, but because it understands and anticipates our changing media situation and  deals with that situation on its own terms. This course, and the Experimental Humanities program in general, will attempt to provide a crossroads between the humanities and computation, in which students with a background in the humanities can discover how computation is increasingly relevant to their interests, and vice-versa.
