<!--
Finally, students will be assigned a classmate's image essay to analyze, in terms of content but especially in terms of its use of reappropriated media and HTML attributes. Part of their analysis will include a marked-up copy of the page's source code, with comments and questions about the author's use of various elements to create an experience that complements their content. We're still very much trying to figure out what "close reading source code" can mean, but some parameters we've been discussing so far are aesthetics, formatting, comments left by the author in the source code, signs of 'borrowed' code, file names, and types of media used.
