<!--
There are a variety of means that might achieve this end, of course, but early on we decided on an instruction in hand-coded HTML as the best method for our purposes. It has a very low bar for entry, the source code is very readable by humans, and the result is a home on the web which the student can truly call their own, and which will be used to host many or all of their multimedia contributions to the class, as well as any other material they wish. It's a very adaptable form for a wide variety of uses. For instance, my presentation today is made up entirely of hand-coded HTML webpages.

What I mean by "hand-coded" is that the entire webpage is designed in a basic text editor, typing in commands like <head>, <body>, <background>, <img src>, etc. which promotes an understanding of programming functions via repeated practice and allows a freedom of expression you don't find in class blogs, wikis, and other spaces for student work online. Students will be encouraged to leave comments in the source code of their homepages, explaining their rationale for certain design choices.
