So after the students are up-to-speed on the basics of HTML web design, and after their homepages are linked together in the class webring, their first assignment will be to create an "About Me" page, similar in concept to those fill-in-the-blank "Info" sections offered by Facebook and other online social networks, but more flexible in terms of how the user wishes to describe theirself. Students will be asked to include at least 5 pieces of media on their page which somehow illustrate what's important to them. 

Maria and I have done a test run of this assignment, so I'll show you how we went about it. You can see that the resulting pages look very different, and in this way better reflect our intentions with sharing this information about ourselves online. In the eyes of Facebook, we are all 12-point Tahoma text against a white background under a blue navigation bar, a representation of our individuality has been subsumed by a brand. The expansion of that representation into a variety of media and formatting options allows the user to consider how different media allow for different messages, in the tradition of McLuhan.
