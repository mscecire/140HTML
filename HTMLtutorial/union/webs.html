Despite the popularity of Facebook and other contemporary social networking tools which purport to give their users a "homepage," these services severely restrict creative output with their own designs and ideologies. The creation of one's own HTML homepage is a way to circumvent these limitations. Starting from a blank slate, students will be the sole designers and webmasters of this space. Hopefully this will create a sense of empowerment for the students, as it has for me, in which the behind-the-curtains goings-on of the rest of the internet will begin to reveal themselves as more transparent, more understandable, and more subject to critical thought and usage.

My fascination with the aesthetics and conceptual framework of hand-coded HTML started with my participation in and study of the early web. In preparation for making their own homepages, our students will be reading two essays entitled "The Vernacular Web 1 and 2" by Olia Lialina, a Russian internet artist pioneer, web historian, and theorist.

The first essay, subtitled "The Indigenous and The Barbarians," is a lament for the loss of the aesthetics and principles of the early web, or Web 1.0. She writes, "the web of the mid 90's... was bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts."

The second is a survey of amateur aesthetics on web 2.0. It takes animated glitter graphics as its primary example and offers side-by-side comparisons of similar graphics, web 1.0 and now. She concludes that what once moved now only shimmers, an aesthetic symbol of the ever-widening gap between web professionals and web amateurs. "Home pages no longer exist," she writes, "The new generation of Web users create accounts, profiles, journals, spaces, channels, or blogs."
