<br><br>
<font style="background-color: white">
For your second homepage project, you will collect at least 5 pieces of media from your classmates' homepages, either downloading and resaving them to your assets folder OR using their URL locations. These images, animations, sounds, and videos, as well as any others you wish to include from different sources, should be constructed in the form of an "experimental media essay" on a topic of your choice.</font>

<br><br>

<font style="background-color: white">
<li>There are no strict guidelines for the organization or theme of your media essay. Use your knowledge of HTML to organize your media in a way that makes an argument, asks a question, gives a feeling, etc. This project is intended as an introduction to experimental production concepts, specifically in regards to the re-use and re-contextualization of media.</font>

<br>[note from MP, our original student collaborator: most of the examples are of an artistic nature, only because that is where my interests lie and these are the image essays I am aware of. Please feel free to structure your media essay much differently than the ones below. Also please send in any other examples of image essays you know!]
