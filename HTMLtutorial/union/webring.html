<!--
Aside from a revival of Web 1.0 design methods in our course, we are also making use of a very 1.0 networking structure, the webring. Quoting Wikipedia, a webring "is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites, but have since fallen out of general use and become rare."

The students, Maria, and myself will all maintain websites connected via the Intro to Media Webring. Users will be able to navigate through the sites one by one, by clicking the "Next" button, or select one from the complete list, also available through the navigation bar.
