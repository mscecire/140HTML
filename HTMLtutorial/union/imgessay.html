The next phase of this project will be for the students to look through each other's contributions to the "About Me" assignment, downloading pieces of media they find to be of interest as they go. They will then use at least five of those borrowed images, animations, videos, and sounds --as well as any other media they would like-- in a new composition, an image essay on a subject of their choice. An image that one student used as a representation of their "favorite animal" in the "About Me" project may appear again as a pictogram in an imagined conversation between two world leaders, for instance, or as an example in a critical history of "cuteness as commodity," or in a collection of "photographs with lens flare" which includes quotes from Pagan sun-worshiping rituals. Here is my own image essay, a proposal for a formal linearity between two seemingly disparate images originally included in Maria's "About Me" page.

We've been talking, as we go through the theoretical readings to be included next semester, about a 'course thesis,' an argument which our selection of materials and assignments implicitly makes. Here's one I thought might be fitting, from Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art In The Age of Mechanical Reproduction": "Tactile appropriation is accomplished not so much by attention as by habit... For the tasks which face the human apparatus of perception at the turning points of history cannot be solved by optical means, that is, by contemplation, alone. They are mastered gradually by habit, under the guidance of tactile appropriation."

I'm a Film and Electronic Arts major at Bard, so much of my interest in computation as well as media theory comes through the arts. As such, I've always been a sucker for this line, from Marshall McLuhan's "The Medium Is The Message": "The serious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity, just because he is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception."

If artists--or producers, to be more liberal--are the only people "to enounter technology with impunity," we have the responsibility to ourselves and to society to become producers of media. Since the medium of our day is the computer (and, increasingly, the surrounding media which have been altered, absorbed, or created by the computer,) we must learn to become critical and effective producers of computational media.

In addition to McLuhan, Benjamin, and other media theory classics, I've also spent the summer re-reading a few essays manifestos by artists who are thinking about how the internet has affected what it means to produce and consume artistic products.

One of these artists, Seth Price, has this to say in his essay entitled "Dispersion": "With more and more media readily available through this unruly archive [the internet], the task becomes one of packaging, producing, reframing, and distributing; a mode of production analogous not to the creation of material goods, but to the production of social contexts, using existing material."

Another, Artie Vierkant, writes in "The Image Object Post-Internet," "culture Post-Internet is made up of reader-authors who by necessity must regard all cultural output as an idea or work in progress able to be taken up and continued by any of its viewers."

These are a few of the ideas which I hope to get students thinking about via the "Img Essay" assignment. As they are re-using and re-contextualizing media they find on their classmates' homepages, media which was likely in circulation elsewhere before that as well, we can begin to talk about how media is no longer simply a book or a  film or a painting, but in fact an endless continuum of copies, versions, appropriations, bootlegs, reminders... etc. all of which can be employed in an analysis of that media.
