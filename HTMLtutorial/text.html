<!-- if you want to change the background color of your page to something other than the default white, you would do it right here in the first 'body' tag by adding the word 'bgcolor' and then the name or color code of the color you would rather. here i've made the page a light grey. -->

<!--for changing the text color, use the below syntax. when picking the color, you can use english for basic colors (i.e. white, green, black, etc.) or HTML color codes for a more varied pallette. for instance, both versions in the example below look the same on the webpage. #FF0000 is the code for red and #0000FF is the code for blue. (be sure to add the '#' to the beginning of the color codes.) a full list of HTML color codes is available here: http://www.immigration-usa.com/html_colors.html -->

<font color="red">different</font> <font color="blue">colors</font>

<font color="#FF0000">different</font> <font color="#0000FF">colors</font>

<br><br>

<font style="background-color: yellow">highlighted</font>

<font style="background-color: green">text</font>

<!-- you can also mix and match different color and highlighting attributes, all within the 'font' tag --> 

<font color="red" style="background-color: black">highlighted and colored</font>

<!-- tables are a super useful way of organizing content on the web. besides text, you can also put images, animations, sounds, and videos in tables! -->

<table border="1"> <!-- the '1' sets the width of the border. you can also make a table without a visible border, just change the '1' to a '0' -->
<tr> <!-- begins a new table row -->
<td>A</td> <!-- creates a new table divider -->
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr> <!-- ends the first row -->
<tr> <!-- begins the second row -->
<td>D</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr> <!-- ends the second row -->
</table> <!-- closes the table -->

<!-- there's plenty of other ways to mess around with your text besides these. if you find yourself wanting to do something you don't already know how to do, just search for your question or a keyword with the word "HTML." There are plenty of resources online for learning a lot more about HTML than this little webpage could teach you. -->
