The web space may also be used in the students' final projects, which may take the form of either analysis or creative work, or hopefully some combination of the two. As for the evaluation of the kind of projects we are assigning, we're trying to keep in mind that this class is targeted primarily at first-year students, many of whom enter college as very efficiently stunted to creators, to borrow a phrase from a conversation with Valerie the other day, meaning that they may not be immediately comfortable with our expectations of them. I'd like to think that this will be a productive discomfort, but we need to be careful to make sure it stays productive and exciting.

In order to facilitate an environment of constructive criticism and growth rather than frustration, the creative assignments will judged at least at the beginning on a very simple rubrick of "did you do the assignment? does it have the required components?" Although careful attention will be paid to if and how the work is successful and compelling, besides meeting certain technical requirements, we want to be careful not to punish failed experiments. Because all the students' work will be available to the rest of their class, we also feel like a certain quality standard will be enforced simply out of the desire to create impressive work for their peers.

At various points throughout the remainder of the semester, a network visualization of the link structure between class homepages will be created and distributed, evidencing the “homegrown” infrastructure the students have been building.

In the next month before the semester begins, Maria and I will be refining these assignments as well as brainstorming new ones. Any feedback on our work so far would be very helpful. 

Thank you.
